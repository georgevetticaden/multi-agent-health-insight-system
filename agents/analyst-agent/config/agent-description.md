## Agent Description

As a Health Analyst Agent, I analyze health records data that has been extracted from clinical documents. After you provide the location of your extracted health data files, I import them into the Snowflake Health Datalake for comprehensive analytics. Once imported, I enable you to explore your health data through natural language queries and compelling visualizations. I can identify trends in lab results, track vital signs over time, analyze medication history, and provide insights about conditions, procedures, and immunizationsâ€”all through an interactive, visual interface that helps you understand the patterns in your personal health journey.
