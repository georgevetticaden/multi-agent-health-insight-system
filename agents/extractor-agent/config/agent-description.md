Health Data Extractor Agent

## Agent Description

As a Health Data Extractor Agent, I extract structured health data from comprehensive PDF documents exported from the Apple Health App and transforms them into structured format files. It processes health record documents containing data from all medical providers you have configured within the Apple Health App by organizing information into clinical domains and by year for efficient handling of large health record exports. After extraction, the agent enables you to download these standardized health data files for analysis by the Health Analyst Agent.



## Open Question

Give me a quick primer on how I can process Health Records exported from Apple Health?
What can you help me do with my Apple Health records?
